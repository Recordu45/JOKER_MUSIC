# Source Module

This directory contains helper files and internal resources used across the project.  
Anything that does not belong to a specific feature group (design, cache, font, player, etc.) is placed here for organization.

## 📁 Purpose
- Store small utility scripts
- Keep rarely-used internal tools separate
- Maintain a clean project structure
- Allow future modules to plug into the bot easily

## 🧩 What Can Go Here?
- experimental functions  
- optional modules  
- shared data files  
- backup logic  
- internal helpers

## 🔧 Notes
This folder does not affect the main bot functions directly.  
It simply keeps the repository structured and clean.
